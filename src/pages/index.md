        To provide excellence in Islamic education in order to balance the
        physical and spiritual development of MMU students. Moreover, Islamic
        education deals with universal education but also education for

        Promoting student cohesion. This is is the process of building shared
        ideals while simultaneously eliminating gaps. The Prophet P.B.U.H
        treated all people well, including non- Muslims. Allah enjoined
        fairness, kindness, good treatment and rendering back trust for Muslims
        and non-Muslims alike

        Addressing the needs of MMU students. Islam extends beyond worship and
        preaching, it's also about living, with justice and fairness, to make
        the world better tomorrow than it is today.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
