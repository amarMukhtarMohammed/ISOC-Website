Here at Manchester Metropolitan University we aim to be the Muslim voice on campus for students led by studentsÂ 

For many, university is a period of time that is used as an academic and spiritual development stepping stone, We as an ISOC aim to facilitate this development while easing the spiritual aspect for all our members on campus.
